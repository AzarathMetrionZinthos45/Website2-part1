            <h1>Description on five reliable or long haul planes.</h1>
            <p>The Modern Flagships (Twin-Engine Efficiency)
                These newer, twin-engine aircraft have largely replaced older four-engine giants because they offer
                better fuel economy
                and lower maintenance costs.
                Airbus A350: Known as the "Extra Wide Body" (XWB), it features a distinctive "raccoon mask" cockpit
                window. It is built
                with over 50% composite materials, making it lighter and more fuel-efficient.
                Range: Up to 8,700 nm for the A350-1000, making it one of the longest-range jets in service.
                Capacity: Typically carries 300–410 passengers depending on the variant and configuration.

                wingtips and scalloped engine nacelles (which reduce noise). It was the
                first airliner to have a fuselage constructed primarily of composite materials.
                Features: Higher cabin humidity and larger, electronically dimmable windows to reduce jet lag.
                Capacity: Usually seats between 240 and 330 passengers across its three variants (-8, -9, -10).<img

                Giants (High Capacity)
                Airbus A380: The world's largest passenger plane, featuring two full decks. While production has ended,
                it remains
                famous for its quiet ride and massive capacity, often exceeding 500 seats.<img

                Boeing 747 ("Queen of the Skies"): Instantly recognizable by its upper-deck hump. Now mostly used for
                cargo, the latest
                747-8 remains one of the world's fastest commercial jets.

                The Reliable Workhorse
                Boeing 777 ("Triple Seven"): The most successful large twin-engine jet. It is powerful and versatile,
                with the upcoming
                777X variant featuring folding wingtips to fit into standard airport gates.<img
